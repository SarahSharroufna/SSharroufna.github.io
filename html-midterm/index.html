    <!-- This is an ordered list for the errors -->
    <ol>
        <li> DOCTYPE is missing. </li>
        <li>language attribute in the html should be lang.</li>
        <li>html shouldn't be inside head tag. So, I placed that before the head tag.</li>
        <li>head tag doesn't have a closing tag. So, I added one.</li>
        <br>
        <li>h1 tag doesn't have a closing tag. So, I added one for it.</li>
        <li>p tag doesn't have an opening tag. So, I added one for it.</li>
        <li> ol tag has a closing tag of different type which is ul. So, I changed the closing tag to ol to be the same.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>The second p tag doesn't have an ending tag. So, I added one. </li>
        <li>Image 1 is missing alt. So, I added "programmerStateImage" as in the alt attribute.</li>
        <li>img tag is a void tag, it doesn't need closing tag. But I see closing tag after the anchor tag which is
            wrong. So, I removed it.</li>
        <li>The first anchor tag doesn't have a closing tag. So, I added one.</li>
        <br>
        <li>table tag doesn't have a closing tag. So, I added one.</li>
        <li>In the cell with 25, the ending tag is missing /. So, I added it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Error image source should be written as src. So, I change it.</li>
        <li>center tag is deprecated. So, I changed it to div with text-align: center.</li>
        <li>To change the background-color of the paragraph. We need to use the style attribute. So, I added somthing
            like this
            style="background-color: lightgray</li>
        <li> The comment is not closed properly. So, I closed it.</li>
        <li>The second Anchor tag doesn't have a closing tag which was affecting all the text after it. So, I added a
            closing tag for it.</li>
        <li>em and p tag are swapped. The nested tag em should close first, and then the outer tag p should close.</li>
        <br>
        <li>dl tag should have dt and dd tags inside it not li. So, I added those instead of li</li>
    </ol>
